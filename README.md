# Replication of *Sexism and the Far-Right Vote: The Individual Dynamics of Gender Backlash* (Anduiza & Rico, 2022)

## Project Overview

This is a replication of the 2019 binary logit model found in Table 1 of the study [“Sexism and the Far-Right Vote: The Individual Dynamics of Gender Backlash” (Anduiza & Rico 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12759).

The original analysis examines the relationship between sexist attitudes and support for far-right political parties in 2019 and 2020. The authors argue that gender backlash—a reactionary response to perceived advances in gender equality—plays a crucial role in shaping voting behavior. In our replication, we further this analysis by probing whether fitting a simpler logistic regression model sufficiently explains the observed data, as well as examining the effect of a single predictor (`nativism`) affects predicted voter behavior.

This is part of the final project for the course CSS 205/POLI 271, "Advanced Statistical Applications".
